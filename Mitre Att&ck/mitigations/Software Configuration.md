## M1054

Implement configuration changes to software (other than the operating system) to mitigate security risks associated to how the software operates.


### Techniques Addressed by Mitigation

| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[Spearphishing Link\|T1566.002]] | Spearphishing Link | Use anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms to filter messages based on validity checks of the sender domain (using SPF) and integrity of messages (using DKIM). Enabling these mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients (intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message filtering and validation.(Citation: Microsoft Anti Spoofing)(Citation: ACSC Email Spoofing).<br /><br />Furthermore, policies may enforce / install browser extensions that protect against IDN and homograph attacks. |
| [[Web Session Cookie\|T1550.004]] | Web Session Cookie | Configure browsers or tasks to regularly delete persistent cookies. |
| [[SNMP (MIB Dump)\|T1602.001]] | SNMP (MIB Dump) | Allowlist MIB objects and implement SNMP views.(Citation: Cisco Securing SNMP) |
| [[Steal Web Session Cookie\|T1539]] | Steal Web Session Cookie | Configure browsers or tasks to regularly delete persistent cookies. |
| [[Install Root Certificate\|T1553.004]] | Install Root Certificate | HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) is one method to mitigate potential [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557) situations where and adversary uses a mis-issued or fraudulent certificate to intercept encrypted communications by enforcing use of an expected certificate. (Citation: Wikipedia HPKP) |
| [[Office Test\|T1137.002]] | Office Test | Create the Registry key used to execute it and set the permissions to "Read Control" to prevent easy access to the key without administrator permissions or requiring Privilege Escalation.(Citation: Palo Alto Office Test Sofacy) |
| [[Inter-Process Communication\|T1559]] | Inter-Process Communication | Consider disabling embedded files in Office programs, such as OneNote, that do not work with Protected View.(Citation: Enigma Reviving DDE Jan 2018)(Citation: GitHub Disable DDEAUTO Oct 2017) |
| [[Unused／Unsupported Cloud Regions\|T1535]] | Unused／Unsupported Cloud Regions | Cloud service providers may allow customers to deactivate unused regions.(Citation: CloudSploit - Unused AWS Regions) |
| [[Phishing for Information\|T1598]] | Phishing for Information | Use anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms to filter messages based on validity checks of the sender domain (using SPF) and integrity of messages (using DKIM). Enabling these mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients (intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message filtering and validation.(Citation: Microsoft Anti Spoofing)(Citation: ACSC Email Spoofing) |
| [[Indicator Blocking\|T1562.006]] | Indicator Blocking | Consider automatically relaunching forwarding mechanisms at recurring intervals (ex: temporal, on-logon, etc.) as well as applying appropriate change management to firewall rules and other related system configurations. |
| [[Phishing\|T1566]] | Phishing | Use anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms to filter messages based on validity checks of the sender domain (using SPF) and integrity of messages (using DKIM). Enabling these mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients (intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message filtering and validation.(Citation: Microsoft Anti Spoofing)(Citation: ACSC Email Spoofing) |
| [[Data from Configuration Repository\|T1602]] | Data from Configuration Repository | Allowlist MIB objects and implement SNMP views.(Citation: Cisco Securing SNMP) |
| [[Network Device Configuration Dump\|T1602.002]] | Network Device Configuration Dump | Allowlist MIB objects and implement SNMP views. Disable Smart Install (SMI) if not used.(Citation: Cisco Securing SNMP)(Citation: US-CERT TA18-106A Network Infrastructure Devices 2018)  |
| [[Spearphishing Attachment\|T1566.001]] | Spearphishing Attachment | Use anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms to filter messages based on validity checks of the sender domain (using SPF) and integrity of messages (using DKIM). Enabling these mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients (intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message filtering and validation.(Citation: Microsoft Anti Spoofing)(Citation: ACSC Email Spoofing) |
| [[Dynamic Data Exchange\|T1559.002]] | Dynamic Data Exchange | Consider disabling embedded files in Office programs, such as OneNote, that do not work with Protected View.(Citation: Enigma Reviving DDE Jan 2018)(Citation: GitHub Disable DDEAUTO Oct 2017) |
| [[PowerShell Profile\|T1546.013]] | PowerShell Profile | Avoid PowerShell profiles if not needed. Use the -No Profile flag with when executing PowerShell scripts remotely to prevent local profiles and scripts from being executed. |
| [[Password Managers\|T1555.005]] | Password Managers | Consider re-locking password managers after a short timeout to limit the time plaintext credentials live in memory from decrypted databases. |
| [[Forge Web Credentials\|T1606]] | Forge Web Credentials | Configure browsers/applications to regularly delete persistent web credentials (such as cookies). |
| [[Subvert Trust Controls\|T1553]] | Subvert Trust Controls | HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) is one method to mitigate potential [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557) situations where and adversary uses a mis-issued or fraudulent certificate to intercept encrypted communications by enforcing use of an expected certificate. (Citation: Wikipedia HPKP) |
| [[Web Cookies\|T1606.001]] | Web Cookies | Configure browsers/applications to regularly delete persistent web cookies. |
| [[Office Application Startup\|T1137]] | Office Application Startup | For the Office Test method, create the Registry key used to execute it and set the permissions to "Read Control" to prevent easy access to the key without administrator permissions or requiring Privilege Escalation. (Citation: Palo Alto Office Test Sofacy) |
| [[Safe Mode Boot\|T1562.009]] | Safe Mode Boot | Ensure that endpoint defenses run in safe mode.(Citation: CyberArk Labs Safe Mode 2016) |
| [[Spearphishing Attachment\|T1598.002]] | Spearphishing Attachment | Use anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms to filter messages based on validity checks of the sender domain (using SPF) and integrity of messages (using DKIM). Enabling these mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients (intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message filtering and validation.(Citation: Microsoft Anti Spoofing)(Citation: ACSC Email Spoofing) |

Enabling these mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients (intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message filtering and validation.(Citation: Microsoft Anti Spoofing)(Citation: ACSC Email Spoofing)<br /><br />Furthermore, policies may enforce / install browser extensions that protect against IDN and homograph attacks. Browser password managers may also be configured to only populate credential fields when the URL matches that of the original, legitimate site.  |
| [[Web Session Cookie\|T1506]] | Web Session Cookie | Configure browsers or tasks to regularly delete persistent cookies. |
| [[Install Root Certificate\|T1130]] | Install Root Certificate | HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) is one method to mitigate potential man-in-the-middle situations where and adversary uses a mis-issued or fraudulent certificate to intercept encrypted communications by enforcing use of an expected certificate. (Citation: Wikipedia HPKP) |
| [[PowerShell Profile\|T1504]] | PowerShell Profile | Avoid PowerShell profiles if not needed. Use the <code>-No Profile</code> flag with when executing PowerShell scripts remotely to prevent local profiles and scripts from being executed.  |
| [[Indicator Blocking\|T1054]] | Indicator Blocking | Consider automatically relaunching forwarding mechanisms at recurring intervals (ex: temporal, on-logon, etc.) as well as applying appropriate change management to firewall rules and other related system configurations. |
| [[Dynamic Data Exchange\|T1173]] | Dynamic Data Exchange | Consider disabling embedded files in Office programs, such as OneNote, that do not work with Protected View.(Citation: Enigma Reviving DDE Jan 2018)(Citation: GitHub Disable DDEAUTO Oct 2017) |
