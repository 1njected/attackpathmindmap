| [[Pass the Hash\|T1075]] | Pass the Hash | Limit credential overlap across systems to prevent the damage of credential compromise and reduce the adversary's ability to perform Lateral Movement between systems. |
| [[Application Deployment Software\|T1017]] | Application Deployment Software | Grant access to application deployment systems only to a limited number of authorized administrators.  Verify that account credentials that may be used to access deployment systems are unique and not used throughout the enterprise network. |
| [[Sudo\|T1169]] | Sudo | By requiring a password, even if an adversary can get terminal access, they must know the password to run anything in the sudoers file. |
| [[Kerberoasting\|T1208]] | Kerberoasting | Limit service accounts to minimal required privileges, including membership in privileged groups such as Domain Administrators. (Citation: AdSecurity Cracking Kerberos Dec 2015) |
| [[Windows Admin Shares\|T1077]] | Windows Admin Shares | Deny remote use of local admin credentials to log into systems. Do not allow domain user accounts to be in the local Administrators group multiple systems. |

| [[Bypass User Account Control\|T1088]] | Bypass User Account Control | Remove users from the local administrator group on systems. |
| [[System Firmware\|T1019]] | System Firmware | Prevent adversary access to privileged accounts or access necessary to perform this technique. |
| [[Kernel Modules and Extensions\|T1215]] | Kernel Modules and Extensions | Limit access to the root account and prevent users from loading kernel modules and extensions through proper privilege separation and limiting Privilege Escalation opportunities. |
| [[SSH Hijacking\|T1184]] | SSH Hijacking | Do not allow remote access via SSH as root or other privileged accounts. |
| [[Pass the Ticket\|T1097]] | Pass the Ticket | Limit domain admin account permissions to domain controllers and limited servers. Delegate other admin functions to separate accounts. (Citation: ADSecurity AD Kerberos Attacks) |
| [[Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription\|T1084]] | Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription | Prevent credential overlap across systems of administrator and privileged accounts. (Citation: FireEye WMI 2015) |
| [[Windows Remote Management\|T1028]] | Windows Remote Management | If the service is necessary, lock down critical enclaves with separate WinRM accounts and permissions. |
| [[Web Shell\|T1100]] | Web Shell | Audit account and group permissions to ensure that accounts used to manage servers do not overlap with accounts and permissions of users in the internal network that could be acquired through Credential Access and used to log into the Web server and plant a Web shell or pivot from the Web server into the internal network. (Citation: US-CERT Alert TA15-314A Web Shells) |
| [[Bootkit\|T1067]] | Bootkit | Ensure proper permissions are in place to help prevent adversary access to privileged accounts necessary to install a bootkit. |
| [[Systemd Service\|T1501]] | Systemd Service | The creation and modification of systemd service unit files is generally reserved for administrators such as the Linux root user and other users with superuser privileges.  |
| [[PowerShell\|T1086]] | PowerShell | When PowerShell is necessary, restrict PowerShell execution policy to administrators. Be aware that there are methods of bypassing the PowerShell execution policy, depending on environment configuration. (Citation: Netspi PowerShell Execution Policy Bypass)  |
| [[Sudo and Sudo Caching\|T1548.003]] | Sudo and Sudo Caching | By requiring a password, even if an adversary can get terminal access, they must know the password to run anything in the sudoers file. Setting the <code>timestamp_timeout</code> to 0 will require the user to input their password every time <code>sudo</code> is executed. |
| [[Sudo and Sudo Caching\|T1548.003]] | Sudo and Sudo Caching | By requiring a password, even if an adversary can get terminal access, they must know the password to run anything in the sudoers file. Setting the <code>timestamp_timeout</code> to 0 will require the user to input their password every time <code>sudo</code> is executed. |
| [[System Binary Proxy Execution\|T1218]] | System Binary Proxy Execution | If these binaries are required for use, then restrict execution of them to privileged accounts or groups that need to use them to lessen the opportunities for malicious use. |
| [[Process Injection\|T1055]] | Process Injection | ###Linux<br /><br />Utilize Yama to mitigate ptrace based process injection by restricting the use of ptrace to privileged users only. Other mitigation controls involve the deployment of security kernel modules that provide advanced access control and process restrictions such as SELinux, grsecurity, and AppArmor. |
