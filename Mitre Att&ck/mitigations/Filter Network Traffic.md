### Techniques Addressed by Mitigation

| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[Port Knocking\|T1205.001]] | Port Knocking | Mitigation of some variants of this technique could be achieved through the use of stateful firewalls, depending upon how it is implemented. |
| [[Adversary-in-the-Middle\|T1557]] | Adversary-in-the-Middle | Use network appliances and host-based security software to block network traffic that is not necessary within the environment, such as legacy protocols that may be leveraged for AiTM conditions. |
| [[Protocol Tunneling\|T1572]] | Protocol Tunneling | Consider filtering network traffic to untrusted or known bad domains and resources.  |
| [[Application Exhaustion Flood\|T1499.003]] | Application Exhaustion Flood | Leverage services provided by Content Delivery Networks (CDN) or providers specializing in DoS mitigations to filter traffic upstream from services.(Citation: CERT-EU DDoS March 2017) Filter boundary traffic by blocking source addresses sourcing the attack, blocking ports that are being targeted, or blocking protocols being used for transport. |
| [[DHCP Spoofing\|T1557.003]] | DHCP Spoofing | Consider filtering DHCP traffic on ports 67 and 68 to/from unknown or untrusted DHCP servers. Additionally, port security may also be enabled on layer switches. Furthermore, consider enabling DHCP snooping on layer 2 switches as it will prevent DHCP spoofing attacks and starvation attacks. Consider tracking available IP addresses through a script or a tool. <br /><br />Additionally, block DHCPv6 traffic and incoming router advertisements, especially if IPv6 is not commonly used in the network.(Citation: ntlm_relaying_kerberos_del) |
| [[Reflection Amplification\|T1498.002]] | Reflection Amplification | When flood volumes exceed the capacity of the network connection being targeted, it is typically necessary to intercept the incoming traffic upstream to filter out the attack traffic from the legitimate traffic. Such defenses can be provided by the hosting Internet Service Provider (ISP) or by a 3rd party such as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or providers specializing in DoS mitigations.(Citation: CERT-EU DDoS March 2017)<br /><br />Depending on flood volume, on-premises filtering may be possible by blocking source addresses sourcing the attack, blocking ports that are being targeted, or blocking protocols being used for transport.(Citation: CERT-EU DDoS March 2017)<br /><br />As immediate response may require rapid engagement of 3rd parties, analyze the risk associated to critical resources being affected by Network DoS attacks and create a disaster recovery plan/business continuity plan to respond to incidents.(Citation: CERT-EU DDoS March 2017) |
| [[DNS\|T1071.004]] | DNS | Consider filtering DNS requests to unknown, untrusted, or known bad domains and resources. Resolving DNS requests with on-premise/proxy servers may also disrupt adversary attempts to conceal data within DNS packets.  |
