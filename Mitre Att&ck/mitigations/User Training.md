## M1017

Train users to be aware of access or manipulation attempts by an adversary to reduce the risk of successful spearphishing, social engineering, and other techniques that involve user interaction.


### Techniques Addressed by Mitigation

| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[Spearphishing via Service\|T1566.003]] | Spearphishing via Service | Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing messages with malicious links. |
| [[User Execution\|T1204]] | User Execution | Use user training as a way to bring awareness to common phishing and spearphishing techniques and how to raise suspicion for potentially malicious events. |
| [[Code Repositories\|T1213.003]] | Code Repositories | Develop and publish policies that define acceptable information to be stored in code repositories. |
| [[Unsecured Credentials\|T1552]] | Unsecured Credentials | Ensure that developers and system administrators are aware of the risk associated with having plaintext passwords in software configuration files that may be left on endpoint systems or servers. |
| [[Data from Information Repositories\|T1213]] | Data from Information Repositories | Develop and publish policies that define acceptable information to be stored in repositories. |
| [[Phishing for Information\|T1598]] | Phishing for Information | Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing attempts. |
| [[Confluence\|T1213.001]] | Confluence | Develop and publish policies that define acceptable information to be stored in Confluence repositories. |
| [[Domain Accounts\|T1078.002]] | Domain Accounts | Applications may send push notifications to verify a login as a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA). Train users to only accept valid push notifications and to report suspicious push notifications. |
| [[ARP Cache Poisoning\|T1557.002]] | ARP Cache Poisoning | Train users to be suspicious about certificate errors. Adversaries may use their own certificates in an attempt to intercept HTTPS traffic. Certificate errors may arise when the application’s certificate does not match the one expected by the host. |
| [[Spearphishing Link\|T1598.003]] | Spearphishing Link | Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing attempts. Additionally, users may perform visual checks of the domains they visit; however, homographs in ASCII and in IDN domains may render manual checks difficult. Phishing training and other cybersecurity training may raise awareness to check URLs before visiting the sites. |
| [[Spearphishing Service\|T1598.001]] | Spearphishing Service | Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing attempts. |
| [[Adversary-in-the-Middle\|T1557]] | Adversary-in-the-Middle | Train users to be suspicious about certificate errors. Adversaries may use their own certificates in an attempt to intercept HTTPS traffic. Certificate errors may arise when the application’s certificate does not match the one expected by the host. |
| [[Cached Domain Credentials\|T1003.005]] | Cached Domain Credentials | Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts. |
| [[OS Credential Dumping\|T1003]] | OS Credential Dumping | Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts. |
| [[NTDS\|T1003.003]] | NTDS | Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts. |
| [[Browser Session Hijacking\|T1185]] | Browser Session Hijacking | Close all browser sessions regularly and when they are no longer needed. |
| [[Software Deployment Tools\|T1072]] | Software Deployment Tools | Have a strict approval policy for use of deployment systems. |
| [[Malicious Image\|T1204.003]] | Malicious Image | Train users to be aware of the existence of malicious images and how to avoid deploying instances and containers from them. |
| [[Credentials In Files\|T1552.001]] | Credentials In Files | Ensure that developers and system administrators are aware of the risk associated with having plaintext passwords in software configuration files that may be left on endpoint systems or servers. |
| [[Double File Extension\|T1036.007]] | Double File Extension | Train users to look for double extensions in filenames, and in general use training as a way to bring awareness to common phishing and spearphishing techniques and how to raise suspicion for potentially malicious events. |
| [[Multi-Factor Authentication Interception\|T1111]] | Multi-Factor Authentication Interception | Remove smart cards when not in use. |
| [[Steal Application Access Token\|T1528]] | Steal Application Access Token | Users need to be trained to not authorize third-party applications they don’t recognize. The user should pay particular attention to the redirect URL: if the URL is a misspelled or convoluted sequence of words related to an expected service or SaaS application, the website is likely trying to spoof a legitimate service. Users should also be cautious about the permissions they are granting to apps. For example, offline access and access to read emails should excite higher suspicions because adversaries can utilize SaaS APIs to discover credentials and other sensitive communications. |
| [[Spearphishing Attachment\|T1598.002]] | Spearphishing Attachment | Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing attempts. |
| [[Template Injection\|T1221]] | Template Injection | Train users to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails that could be used to deliver malicious documents. |
| [[LSASS Memory\|T1003.001]] | LSASS Memory | Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts. |
| [[GUI Input Capture\|T1056.002]] | GUI Input Capture | Use user training as a way to bring awareness and raise suspicion for potentially malicious events and dialog boxes (ex: Office documents prompting for credentials). |
| [[Browser Extensions\|T1176]] | Browser Extensions | <br />Close out all browser sessions when finished using them to prevent any potentially malicious extensions from continuing to run. |
| [[Spearphishing Attachment\|T1566.001]] | Spearphishing Attachment | Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails. |
| [[Cloud Accounts\|T1078.004]] | Cloud Accounts | Applications may send push notifications to verify a login as a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA). Train users to only accept valid push notifications and to report suspicious push notifications. |

| [[Spearphishing Link\|T1566.002]] | Spearphishing Link | Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails with malicious links which includes phishing for consent with OAuth 2.0. Additionally, users may perform visual checks of the domains they visit; however, homographs in ASCII and in IDN domains may render manual checks difficult. Phishing training and other cybersecurity training may raise awareness to check URLs before visiting the sites. |
| [[Chat Messages\|T1552.008]] | Chat Messages | Ensure that developers and system administrators are aware of the risk associated with sharing unsecured passwords across communication services. |
| [[Malicious Link\|T1204.001]] | Malicious Link | Use user training as a way to bring awareness to common phishing and spearphishing techniques and how to raise suspicion for potentially malicious events. |

| [[Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation\|T1621]] | Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation | Train users to only accept 2FA/MFA requests from login attempts they initiated, to review source location of the login attempt prompting the 2FA/MFA requests, and to report suspicious/unsolicited prompts. |
